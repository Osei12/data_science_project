                    <p>
                        Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from noisy, structured and unstructured data .Many statisticians, including Nate Silver, have argued that data science is not a new field, but rather another name for statistics .
                        Others argue data science focuses on problems and techniques unique to digital data .The term “data science” has been traced back to 1974, when Peter Naur proposed it as an alternative name for computer science .In 1985, C.F.Jeff Wu used the term Data Science for the first time in a lecture given to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing .There is still no consensus on the definition of data science and it is considered by some to be a buzzword .
                        The professional title of “data scientist” has been attributed to DJ Patil and Jeff Hammerbacher in 2008 .

                        <h3>Data Scientist</h3>
                        <p>
                            The term “data scientist” is a relatively new one in comparison to some of the other roles mentioned here. 
                            Since all the roles discussed below encompass the wider field of data science,
                             the specific job title of “data scientist” can sometimes be perceived as an elevated synonym for “data analyst” but
                              that’s not the case. Data scientists must be a mathematician, a computer scientist, and a business strategist all
                               at once, necessitating expertise in several different disciplines. This complex skill set means that data 
                               scientists need to consistently have one foot in the information technology sector, and another planted 
                               firmly in the business world.
                             That’s part of what makes them in such high demand.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Like many of the roles discussed, data scientists must have a combination of analytic, machine learning, data mining, and statistical skills in addition to experience with algorithms and coding. Data scientists also have expertise in the following programs: R, SAS, Python, Matlab, SQL, Hive, Pig, and Spark. But one of the most important skills that a good data scientist possesses is the ability to explain the significance of data in a way that can be easily understood by others. Polished verbal and written communication skills are key for this role, in a way they may not be for many others listed below.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Often, data scientists will find themselves called upon to express their findings and analysis to their superiors, colleagues on different teams, and even company stakeholders who may (but just as often may not) be able to follow understand the technical jargon that data science professionals likely take for granted. The Harvard Business Review rates this lack of easy communication between data teams and non-technical stakeholders as one of the toughest barriers facing the field. “Data teams know they’re sitting on valuable insights but can’t sell them,” HBR says. “They say decision makers misunderstand or oversimplify their analysis and expect them to do magic, to provide the right answers to all their questions. [Executives] don’t see tangible results because the results aren’t communicated in their language.” This is core to what a good data scientist will be able to do. Explaining what information has discovered and what needs to be done about it now that they have, all in a comprehensive and easily digestible way.Not always an easy task.

                        <p>
                            A data analyst’s role is to collect, process, and perform statistical data analyses with the goal of helping companies make better business decisions. Data analysts are most often responsible for transforming data sets into usable forms, such as reports or presentations. Depending on the industry, this may involve gleaning insight from consumer data sets, making strategic recommendations based on dense financial data, or simply organizing messy data into a more accessible format. A qualified data analyst will have a solid understanding of R, Python, HTML, C/C++ and SQL. These positions are often on the lower end of the organizational chart; however, those are who just entering the data science field will find these roles to be some of the easiest to qualify for and you will have ample opportunity to learn and advance into higher level roles.

                            Thanks to the increasing importance of big data, data architect roles are becoming more common.  This position creates the blueprints for data management systems to integrate, centralize, protect, and maintain data sources. They understand the languages of SQL, XML, Hive, Pig, and Spark as well as the skills of warehouse solutions, systems development, and database architecture. It is a natural evolution from data analyst to database designer, combining both skill sets. The position requires an advanced degree and many years of experience

                        <p>
                            Data engineers are the designers, builders, and managers of the information or big data infrastructure. 
                            They assist in developing the architecture that helps analyze and process data in a manner best suited for
                            their organization. It is their role to also make sure those systems are performing smoothly. 
                            Data engineering differs from other data science careers in that it is focused on the systems and hardware 
                            that facilitates a company’s data activities, rather than analysis of the data itself. 
                            A data engineer has a background in software engineering as well as skills in the following languages: 
                            SQL, HIVe, Pig, R, Matlab, SAS, SPSS, Python, Java, and Ruby. Their duties also involve providing the company 
                            with valuable data warehousing solutions. 
                            This role is considered a senior position and requires an advanced degree and years of experience.

                            The business analyst is often less technically oriented but has a deep knowledge of the different business processes and embodies business intelligence. The role of the business analyst is to improve business processes by serving as a liaison between business and IT with a clear directive to focus on advancing strategic business objectives. Most business analysts are focused on producing usable deliverables, such as reports and presentations, that can be easily understood by others in the organization who are not data scientists themselves. Business analysts possess the basic skills of data visualization tools and data modeling, however their educational background is in business. The duties of a business analyst are very similar to those of a data analyst. Business analysis is an excellent career choice for someone that has a solid foundation in numbers and an active interest in business management or development.

They manage a variety of positions including but not limited to data engineers, data scientists, and data analysts and will often be promoted to their role.
                            They also often serve as the spokesperson for the department, which can require the same level of polished verbal and communication skills that make for a successful data scientist. This role is a senior position that requires an advanced degree as well as many years of supervisory experience.
                            In some businesses and organizations, the data team may even be run by a C-level executive role, often known as the chief data officer.

                            Machine learning is one subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that works with big data applications and is accomplished through advanced mathematics and software programming. By leaps and bounds, business has become the most prominent use of machine learning today. Customer-facing businesses of all types are employing machine learning to better understand customer tendencies and preferences so that they may apply marketing and advertising strategies that accurately and effectively target these tendencies. The goal of machine learning is to program computers to accept real world data from real people utilizing technology and determine from that data the person’s likes and tendencies. These results are then employed to place the most relevant advertisements in front of the customers. Machine learning engineers help manage all of that.
